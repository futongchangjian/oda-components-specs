 TMF OPEN APIs & Events

The following part covers the APIs and Events; This part is split in 3:

List of Exposed APIs - This is the list of APIs available from this component. At this stage we list the APIs, resource and operation with no mention to optionally (in other word no mention about mandatory VS optional resource)
List of Dependent APIs - In order to satisfy the provided API, the  component could require the usage of this set of required APIs. At this stage no optionally is defined and none of this 'required' API is listed as 'mandatory'
List of  Events (generated & consumed ) - The events which the component may generate are listed in this section along with a list of the events which it may consume. Since there is a possibility of multiple sources and receivers for each defined event.
